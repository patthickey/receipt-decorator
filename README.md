receipt-decorator
=================
Created by Patrick Hickey in 2014 for OOD class at Towson U
an example of decorator design pattern

The Headers, Coupons, and Rebates packages are seperate because we were to imagine that they are pulled from the bestbuy website every day.
We were to assume that the main knows how to use them and to hardcore them, but should be able to easily be changed.

This is my first attempt at using a decorator pattern.
